# Date Formatter Challenge

Welcome to my Date Formatter project! This was the fourth JavaScript challenge I completed using freeCodeCamp's curriculum! In this project, I delved into mastering the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. Additionally, I learned how to correctly format dates to suit different needs.

## Project Overview

I explored the intricacies of handling dates in JavaScript through a series of exercises focused on practical applications. The project covered fundamental concepts such as:

- Utilizing the `getDate()`, `getMonth()`, and `getFullYear()` methods to extract specific date components.
- Understanding the nuances of working with the Date object, including time zones and daylight saving time adjustments.
